# Livestock Diseases Reserve Research: Enhancing Disease Management and Prevention in Agricultural Systems

**Author**: [Your Name]  
**Project Description**:  
This project investigates the management and prevention of livestock diseases by exploring the concept of livestock disease reserves. These reserves aim to control the spread of infectious diseases by isolating affected animals or regions and utilizing preventive measures. The study focuses on understanding the effectiveness of disease reserves in preventing outbreaks and improving animal health within agricultural systems.

## Project Overview
Livestock diseases pose significant risks to animal health, food security, and the global economy. This project explores the role of disease reservesâ€”areas designated to control or prevent disease outbreaks in livestock populations. By isolating affected zones and employing preventive measures, these reserves may offer a solution to reduce the spread of disease in livestock farming. The project aims to provide data-driven insights to policymakers and farmers to enhance disease control strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing dynamic features and fetching data from APIs.
- **API Integration**: Fetching data on disease outbreaks from publicly available sources or custom datasets.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deploying the app online.
